<h1>The best heroes in the hardlane</h1>
<h2>My top 3 heroes.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Axe</h3>
<p>
  He has good potential to focus the enemy's damage dealers. Actually, Axe has
  good control abilities.
</p>
<h3>Kunkka</h3>
<p>
  Kunkka is second in my top chart, because he's durable hero and has good
  farming potential.
</p>
<h3>Centaur Warruner</h3>
<p>
  Centaur is in 3rd place for one reason only - his armor deficiency. But he
  also absorbs damage very well.
</p>
<h4>Night Stalker</h4>
<p>
  Balanar is a very mobile hero, but only at night. Nevertheless, he is a great
  disabler, initiator and nuker.
