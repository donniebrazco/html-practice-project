<h3>Abilities:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>BERSERKER'S CALL</li>
  <p>
    Axe taunts nearby enemy units, forcing them to attack him while he gains
    bonus armor during the duration.
  </p>
  <li>BATTLE HUNGER</li>
  <p>
    Enrages an enemy unit, causing it to take damage over time until it kills
    another unit or the duration ends. The damage is increased by a factor of

    Axe.
  </p>
  <li>COUNTER HELIX</li>

    After a set number of attacks, Axe will perform a helix counter attack,
    dealing pure damage to all nearby enemies.
  </p>
  <li>CULLING BLADE</li>
  <p>
    Axe spots a weakness and strikes, dealing pure damage. When an enemy hero is
    killed with Culling Blade, its cooldown is reset, and all nearby allied
    units gain bonus movement speed and armor.
