<h1>Who are offlaners in Dota 2?</h1>
<p>
  Offlaners are heroes who play in the hard lane (also known as the offlane).
  This lane is usually far from their team’s tower, making it more dangerous and
  harder to survive. An offlaner needs to endure constant pressure from the
  enemy carry and support while still gaining gold and experience.
</p>

<p>
  Main responsibilities of an offlaner include:
  <ul>
    <li>harassing the enemy carry to slow their farm;</li>
    <li>staying alive under pressure;</li>
    <li>reaching key levels and items quickly;</li>
    <li>later in the game — initiating team fights or absorbing enemy damage.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  This role is often filled by heroes with strong crowd control, high durability, or team-oriented auras.
